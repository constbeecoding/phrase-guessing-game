# **A Game Show App**

## Let me tell you, learning JavaScript was a learning curve! This was the first time I was really trying to write Vanilla JS from scratch whilst referring to documentation. I am proud of what I am learning because of this project though!

## Struggles 
- Mis spelling method calls.
- Reversing brackets
- Training my "Programmer Brain"

## Triumphs
- Playing around with styling.
- I built a functioning GAME. 
- Learned how to use and manipulate arrays.
